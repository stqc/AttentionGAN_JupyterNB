# AttentionGAN_JupyterNB
### A simplified version of the AttentionGAN 
<br>
Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks.<br>
This model was trained on a GTX 1060 6G.<br>
Trainig time varies with dataset, but on an average I had to train for atleast 5hrs minimum to see decent results.
